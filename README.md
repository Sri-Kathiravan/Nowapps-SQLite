# nowapps_sqllite

A new Flutter app with SQLite database connection. App contains two different screens and some bottom sheets.
  1) Launching screen.
  2) Home screen shows the form.
  3) Bottom sheets. 
  
Please find an APK file in example/apk directory to install and verify and I've attached my screenshots in example/screenshot directory.

In this app I've used four libraries from [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/)
- [sqflite: SQLite plugin for Flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/sqflite)
- [flutter_bloc: To implement BLoC pattern](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_bloc)
- [fluttertoast: To show toast messages](https://pub.dev/packages/fluttertoast)
- [path_provider: To find commonly used locations on the filesystem](https://pub.dev/packages/path_provider)
